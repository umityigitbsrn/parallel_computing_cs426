## Serial part
For compiling the serial part, C++14 needed because the "unordered_map" library is used in the implementation. Also, for unordered map I took some code segment from the documentation of the C++14. Therefore, there could be some similaritiesin the utils.h file.

## Parallel part
In the parallel part, the given server is used. Therefore, I did not use nvprof command in this project.
